The first indicator I saw was the vertical yellow rectangular sign. This sign is common in Oceana regions, so I had a rough area.

Trying to read the brown sign, I can see mention of ```LB4 Lookout 400m```. In my opinion this was the only readable item on the sign. A google search reveals this on Christmas Island.

After looking at google streetview of the island, I noticed the same truck bed that was in the geosint, so I knew I had the right island. As to where on the island, I did not know.

I then started looking for more information about the Roads to Recovery sign. This was a project in australia, and conventeniently has a Projects website where you can search for "Projects near me"

Looking through each project through the above link gives you details about where that project happened. Luckily, the second result on North West Point Road matched up with the geosint location! Right at the intersection of North-West Point Rd and East West Baseline Rd
